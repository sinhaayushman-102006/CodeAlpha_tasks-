## 🔎 Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removed extra spaces in column names
   * Cleaned and converted date values to datetime format
   * Handled missing and invalid entries
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Time-series analysis of unemployment rates
   * Region-wise comparison
   * Seasonal pattern analysis
4. **COVID-19 Impact Analysis**

   * Compared unemployment rates before and during lockdown
5. **Visualization & Insights**

   * Line plots, bar charts, and box plots

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Unemployment rates in India were relatively stable before 2020
* A **sharp spike in unemployment** was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown period (March–May 2020)
* Significant **regional disparities** exist in unemployment levels
* Post-lockdown recovery was **gradual and uneven** across states

---

## 🦠 Impact of COVID-19

* Nationwide lockdowns caused severe employment disruptions
* Informal and daily-wage workers were most affected
* Labour participation rates declined sharply during peak lockdown months

---

## 🏛 Policy Suggestions

* Emergency employment and income support during crises
